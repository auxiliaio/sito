A company profile provides a quick look into a company, allowing various people to get a general idea of what the companyâ€™s products or services are, its target market, its unique strengths, its track record, and whether it is a good entity to do business with. Here are some of the company profiles I've worked on.

An attractive company profile design says a lot about the company it presents. Aside from the content, the design is also an integral factor in creating a great company profile.
