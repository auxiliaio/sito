GMC Kenya LLP (formerly Gitahi Mwangi & Co.), is an independent accounting and advisory services firm of Certified Public Accountants of Kenya established in Nairobi in 2014. The firm is licensed by Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Kenya (ICPAK).

I was tasked with designing a new website to showcase their company and the services they provide. Some aspects of the site are displayed below:

<div class="media logos">
<ul>
{% include media-lista.html file="gmc_01.jpg" caption="Homepage" %}
<div class="break"></div>
{% include media-lista.html file="gmc_02.jpg" caption="Company Values" %}
<div class="break"></div>
{% include media-lista.html file="gmc_03.jpg" caption="Portfolio" %}
<div class="break"></div>
{% include media-lista.html file="gmc_04.jpg" caption="Why Choose GMC" %}
<div class="break"></div>
</ul>
</div>

{% include pulsanti.html title="VISIT WEBSITE" link="https://gmckenya.co.ke"%}

A website’s attractiveness is important, but no matter how awesome its pages may be, if the coding does not meet certain standards of performance, search engine friendliness or device and browser compatibility, it will not be a winner – by any measure.

Let's avoid that. Get in touch and I'll deliver a great website that caters to your needs as well as those of your target audience.
