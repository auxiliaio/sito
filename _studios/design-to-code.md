Design to Code is the process of converting a digital design to HTML, CSS and JavaScript code. These can then be used as a website template or used in other projects such as WordPress themes, Laravel and React applications.

This is where I come in. Working with assets designed in Adobe Photoshop, Sketch, Invision, Adobe XD and Figma, I can seamlessly transform them into user and developer friendly code, such as the ones below:
<div class="media logos">
<ul>
{% include media-lista.html file="codice/awfv2.jpg" caption="African Wildlife Foundation Intranet Redesign" %}
<div class="break"></div>
{% include media-lista.html file="codice/aas.jpg" caption="AAS Intranet" %} 
<div class="break"></div>
	{% include media-lista.html file="codice/awfv1.jpg" caption="African Wildlife Foundation Intranet" %}
<div class="break"></div>
{% include media-lista.html file="codice/paset.jpg" caption="PASET - RSIF" %}
	<div class="break"></div>
</ul>
</div>
A website’s attractiveness is important, but no matter how awesome its pages may be, if the coding does not meet certain standards of performance, search engine friendliness or device and browser compatibility, it will not be a winner – by any measure.

Let's avoid that. Get in touch and I'll deliver developer friendly code that engineers can build upon quickly while maintaining design and code quality.
