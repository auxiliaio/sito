A logo can be described as the face of a company.  Quite often, itâ€™s the first thing that a potential customer will notice about your business. Usually, people associate a high-quality logo with the quality of services provided by a particular company.

An eye-catching yet professional logo is therefore important to have in order to attract them to your business. Here are some of the logos I've made.
<div class="media logos">
    <ul>
		{% include listalogo.html file="imaru_enterprise.jpg" caption="Imaru Enterprise" %}
		{% include listalogo.html file="bevenju_ventures.jpg" caption="Bevenju Ventures" %}
		{% include listalogo.html file="classic_steel_engineering.jpg" caption="Classic Steel Engineering" %}
		<div class="break"></div>
		{% include listalogo.html file="ican_marketing.jpg" caption="Ican Marketing" %}
		{% include listalogo.html file="container_works_africa.jpg" caption="Container Works Africa" %}
		{% include listalogo.html file="unicity_mall.jpg" caption="Unicity Mall" %}
	</ul>
</div>
A good logo is vital to your company beause it grabs attention, makes a strong first impression, is the foundation of your brand identity, is memorable, separates you from competition, fosters brand loyalty, and is expected by your audience.
