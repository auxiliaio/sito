The African Wildlife Foundation (AWF) is the leading international conservation organisation focused exclusively on Africa's wildlife and wild lands. AWF's programs and conservation strategies are designed to protect the wildlife and wild lands of Africa and ensure a more sustainable future for Africa's people.

In pursuant of their goals, they contracted me to design the foundation of their company intranet, after which it was passed on to developers for final design. The intranet is shown below:

Companies of all sizes often suffer from miscommunication - between executives and middle-management, between departments, between locations, etc. Whether you're trying to collaborate on a document, send an announcement to your team, or gather feedback from your entire department, a well-designed intranet is the best tool for internal communications. 

If your company doesn't have one, or you have an intranet that no one uses, you are missing out on a prime opportunity. Get in touch and we'll work on getting you an intranet your employees will use to increase engagement, improve internal communication, and promote corporate culture.
