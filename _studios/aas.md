The African Academy of Sciences (AAS) is a non-aligned, non-political, not-for-profit pan African organisation. The AASâ€™ vision is to see transformed lives on the African continent through science.

In pursuant of their goals, they contracted me to design the foundation of their company intranet, after which it was passed on to developers for final design. The intranet is shown below:

<div class="media logos">
<ul>
{% include media-lista.html file="aas_01.jpg" caption="Homepage" %}
<div class="break"></div>
{% include media-lista.html file="aas_02.jpg" caption="Other Documents" %}
<div class="break"></div>
{% include media-lista.html file="aas_03.jpg" caption="New Purchase Request" %}
<div class="break"></div>
{% include media-lista.html file="aas_04.jpg" caption="Purchase Requests" %}
<div class="break"></div>
{% include media-lista.html file="aas_05.jpg" caption="Upload New Document" %}

</ul>
</div>

Companies of all sizes often suffer from miscommunication - between executives and middle-management, between departments, between locations, etc. Whether you're trying to collaborate on a document, send an announcement to your team, or gather feedback from your entire department, a well-designed intranet is the best tool for internal communications.

If your company doesn't have one, or you have an intranet that no one uses, you are missing out on a prime opportunity. Get in touch and we'll work on getting you an intranet your employees will use to increase engagement, improve internal communication, and promote corporate culture.
