I"ƒ<p>Design to code is the process of converting a digital design to HTML, CSS and JavaScript code. These can then be used as a website template or used in other projects such as WordPress themes, Laravel and React applications. This is where I come in. Working with assets designed in Invision, Adobe XD and Figma, I can seamlessly convert them into user and developer friendly code.</p>
