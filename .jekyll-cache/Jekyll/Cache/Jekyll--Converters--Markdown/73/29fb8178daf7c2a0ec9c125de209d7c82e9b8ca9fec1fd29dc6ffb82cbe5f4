I"º<p>If thereâ€™s one document standard that has stood the test of time, itâ€™s the Portable Document Format, PDF. This file format is special in that it can be view by a wide variety of devices without installing any additional software. This is due to the fact that it preserves all the fonts, formatting, graphics, and colour of any source document, regardless of the application and platform used to create it. That makes it universal.</p>
