I"U<p>If there’s one document standard that has stood the test of time, it’s the Portable Document Format, PDF. This file format is special in that it can be view by a wide variety of devices without installing any additional software. This is due to the fact that it preserves all the fonts, formatting, graphics, and colour of any source document, regardless of the application and platform used to create it. That makes it universal.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it also makes it difficult to adjust. Changes such as extracting pages, adding more pages and converting to other file formats require special software or services. One of these services is ILovePDF, a freemium web service for working with PDFs.</p>

<h1 id="home-page">Home Page</h1>
<p><a href="https://ILovePDF.com">ILovePDF.com </a> has all its tools front and centre on the homepage. These allow PDFs to be edited in a lot of different ways.</p>

<h1 id="merge-pdf">Merge PDF</h1>
<p>Multiple PDFs can be combined to one using this tool. Select it and you’ll be taken to a page where you can upload the pdfs to be merged. Set the order to be used, then tap Merge PDF.</p>

<h1 id="split-pdf">Split PDF</h1>
<p>The split PDF tool takes a single PDF and either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Splits it by page range, or</li>
  <li>Extracts specific pages from it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Multiple ranges can be set for <em>splitting by range</em>. For <em>extracting pages</em>, all pages can be extracted to single pages, or by specifying which pages to be extracted.</p>

<p>For both options, the resulting files can be merged into a single PDF.</p>

<h1 id="compress-pdf">Compress PDF</h1>
<p>PDFs can get very large, which makes sharing them via email or chat more difficult than necessary. This is where the Compress PDF service comes in play. Tap on it, select the file to be compressed, and leave the compression level as recommended.</p>
