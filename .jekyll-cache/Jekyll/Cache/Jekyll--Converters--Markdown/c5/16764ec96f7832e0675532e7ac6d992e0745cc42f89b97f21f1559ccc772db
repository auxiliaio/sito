<p><strong>Iâ€™m not alone.</strong></p>

<p>A lot of people these days spend a lot of time staring at screens. Admit it, youâ€™re one of them. (If youâ€™re reading this, youâ€™re staring at a screen. Gotcha :-)</p>

<p>These screens are supposed to provide tools that bring innovation into our lives, get people connected and save us some time by facilitating simple tasks. But theyâ€™re having the exact opposite effect in most cases.</p>

<p><strong>Theyâ€™re keeping us constantly distracted.</strong></p>

<p>While weâ€™re fortunate to have so many great tools emerging to help people get their act together, there are literally millions of them and they all have dark and bright sides.</p>

<p><strong>We need a filter.</strong></p>

<p>One that enables us to use tools that lets us connect without getting sucked in. And disconnect, without missing something important.</p>

<p><strong>We need to restore choice.</strong></p>

<p>We need to use tools that help us spend our time well, where apps and services compete for net positive contributions to our lives.</p>
