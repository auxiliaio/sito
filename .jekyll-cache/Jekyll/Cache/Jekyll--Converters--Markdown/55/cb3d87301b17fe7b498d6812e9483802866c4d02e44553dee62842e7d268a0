I"Z<p>Design to code is the process of converting a digital design to HTML, CSS and javaScript code. These can then be used as a website template or converted to other formats such as WordPress, Laravel and React. Working with assets designed in Invision, Adobe XD and Figma, I can seamlessly convert them into user and developer friendly code.</p>
