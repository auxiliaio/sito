I"v!<p>Sometimes you read a book so special that you want to carry it around with you for months after you’ve finished just to stay near it. The Books app allows you to do exactly this, while making the reading experience as fun as possible.</p>

<p>The Books app is the default ebook and pdf reading app on iPhones and iPads. It enables you to add your own books and pdfs, buy and download them from the inbuilt store as well as arrange them into collections for easier management.</p>

<h2 id="reading-now">Reading Now</h2>

<p>The app opens in the Reading Now section, which displays the current and recent books you’ve been reading, as well as an Explore and All-Time Bestsellers section for getting additional books. You can also add books to your Want to Read list and they’ll appear under the Current reading books.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>If you’re still reading this then that means you probably already enjoy reading. Which means I probably don’t have to tell you that reading is simply magical. It’s the only thing in the world that allows you to go and live inside another brain for a little while, see what it sees, feel what it feels, and then leave again. You can achieve all this and more with the Books app.</p>
