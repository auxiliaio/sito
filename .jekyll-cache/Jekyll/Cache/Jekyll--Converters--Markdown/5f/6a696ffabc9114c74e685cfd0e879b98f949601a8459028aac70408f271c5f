I"¡<p>Email is one of the oldest forms of communication we use nowadays. Youâ€™d think weâ€™d have learnt how to send them properly, but nothingâ€™s further from the truth. Email etiquette is hard to come by, but thatâ€™s why youâ€™re reading this.</p>

<p>Sending emails should be like robbing a bank: you get in, do your thing, and get out. In as little as time as possible. Hereâ€™s how to do it properly (send an email, not rob a bank).</p>

<h1 id="start-with-the-subject">Start with the Subject</h1>
<p>The subject is a summary of what the email is about. Starting with it grounds you, keeps you honest. Make sure itâ€™s simple and direct.</p>

<div class="media single">

            <!-- <a class="logo-overlay" href=""></a> -->
        
        
        <div class="caption">
             
            <h3>A short simple subject.</h3>
             
        </div>
        
</div>

<h1 id="add-your-attachments">Add Your Attachments</h1>
<p>Few things are as disappointing as having an email clearly indicating that I should kindly find something attached and not finding it. It sours the whole deal. So donâ€™t be that guy or girl. If you have attachments, attach them first.</p>

<p>And do try to keep the number of attachments small. In case of a large number of files create a compressed folder and send that instead. No one likes the idea of downloading 10 different attachments.</p>

            <!-- <a class="logo-overlay" href=""></a> -->
        
        
        <div class="caption">
             
            <h3>Adding attachments.</h3>
             
        </div>
        
</div>

<h1 id="pick-a-salutation">Pick a Salutation</h1>
<p>This depends on your relationship with the email recipient(s). It can be any of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dear Sir(s)/Madam</li>
  <li>Dear (name of recipient)</li>
  <li>Good (time of day)</li>
  <li>Hello (name of recipient)</li>
  <li>Hi (name of recipient)</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="type-the-email">Type the Email</h1>
<p>Keep it short, about 3 paragraphs long. Let the first paragraph be an introduction to what the email is about, the second be a detailed overview and the third a summary and next step to be taken. The shorter the email the more likely itâ€™s going to get read.</p>

<div class="media single">
    
        <img src="/assets/foto/altro/lazyload.png" data-src="/assets/foto/articolo/emails/email_content.jpg" alt="" class="lazyload" />
            <!-- <a class="logo-overlay" href=""></a> -->
        
        
        <div class="caption">
             
            <h3>Keep it simple and to the point.</h3>
             
        </div>
        
</div>

<h1 id="have-an-a-engaging-signoff">Have an a Engaging Signoff</h1>
<p>Itâ€™s good to end the email on an upbeat manner. This helps them remember you. You can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Compliment/congratulate: Great working with you, keep up the great work</li>
  <li>Express gratitude: Thank you for the consideration, many thanks</li>
  <li>Anticipatory: to an amazing week, looking forward to, until next time, talk soon</li>
  <li>Calls to action: Let me know what you think, letâ€™s catch up sometime</li>
  <li>Personal: Warmest regards, carpe diem, namaste</li>
  <li>When words wonâ€™t do: xoxo, ðŸ™‚</li>
  <li>Common: Sincerely, cheers</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="add-the-email-recipients">Add the Email Recipients</h1>
<p>Once youâ€™re done with the message, itâ€™s time to add the recipients. Be considerate. Donâ€™t be that person that adds everyone in the CC and BCC fields. Only add those individuals that are directly involved in the email content.</p>

            <h3>Adding just the right amount of recipients.</h3>
             
        </div>
        
</div>

<h1 id="send-the-email">Send the Email</h1>
<p>Review the email one last time, then send it. Spark offers a 5 second option to unsend the email in case youâ€™ve forgotten something, or changed your mind.</p>
