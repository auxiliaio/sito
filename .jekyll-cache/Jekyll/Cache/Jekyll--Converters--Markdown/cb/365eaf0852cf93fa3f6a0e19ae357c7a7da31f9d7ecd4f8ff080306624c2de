<p>Design to Code is the process of converting a digital design to HTML, CSS and JavaScript code. These can then be used as a website template or used in other projects such as WordPress themes, Laravel and React applications.</p>

<p>This is where I come in. Working with assets designed in Adobe Photoshop, Sketch, Invision, Adobe XD and Figma, I can seamlessly transform them into user and developer friendly code, such as the ones below:</p>
<div class="media logos">
<ul>
<li class="hvr-float">
    <img src="/assets/foto/varie/lazyload.png" data-src="/assets/foto/studio/codice/awfv1.jpg" alt="African Wildlife Foundation Intranet" class="lazyload" />
    <div class="caption">
        <h3>African Wildlife Foundation Intranet</h3>
    </div>
</li>
<div class="break"></div>
<li class="hvr-float">
    <img src="/assets/foto/varie/lazyload.png" data-src="/assets/foto/studio/codice/awfv2.jpg" alt="African Wildlife Foundation Intranet Redesign" class="lazyload" />
    <div class="caption">
        <h3>African Wildlife Foundation Intranet Redesign</h3>
    </div>
</li>
<div class="break"></div>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Companies of all sizes often suffer from miscommunication - between executives and middle-management, between departments, between locations, etc. Whether youâ€™re trying to collaborate on a document, send an announcement to your team, or gather feedback from your entire department, a well-designed intranet is the best tool for internal communications.</p>

<p>If your company doesnâ€™t have one, or you have an intranet that no one uses, you are missing out on a prime opportunity. Get in touch and weâ€™ll work on getting you an intranet your employees will use to increase engagement, improve internal communication, and promote corporate culture.</p>
