I"H<p>I’m sure you’ve heard of intermittent fasting. It’s currently one of the world’s most popular health trends. It’s been said to cause weight loss, improve metabolic health, protect against diseases and maybe even prolong your life!</p>

<p>But what is it? Intermittent fasting is an eating pattern where you cycle between periods of eating and fasting. It’s not concerned with <em>what</em> you eat, but <em>when</em> you eat. That’s one of the reasons why it’s become so popular, since most of us fast anyway when we’re sleeping.</p>

<p>While the benefits of intermittent fasting are yet to be set in stone, there are a number of apps that can help keep track of your fasting. One of these apps is Zero.</p>

<h1 id="onboarding">Onboarding</h1>
<p>Zero is available on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ke/app/zero-simple-fasting-tracker/id1168348542">App Store</a> and the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zerofasting.zero&amp;hl=en_US">Google Play Store</a>. While it’s free to download and use, it also has a subscription plan that enhances the fasting experience.</p>

<p>Launching the app takes you through a 5-step onboarding process that introduces the app, guides you through choosing a fasting plan, setting the timer and creating an account to track your fasting.</p>

<p>You can also log into your account if you’ve got one already.</p>

<h1 id="timer">Timer</h1>
<p>Since intermittent fasting tracks when you have your meals, a reliable timer is integral to the whole process. Zero delivers one that does just that in the timer screen.</p>

<p>The total number of people fasting at the current time is displayed at the top, with your current fast displayed under it, which you can tap to change the type of fast you’re doing.</p>

<p>The large circular timer is displayed at the center of the screen, and it has two states:</p>

<h2 id="pre-fasting">Pre-Fasting</h2>
<p>This displays the time since the last fast, as well as the upcoming fast duration. You can also change the type of fast, set a fasting reminder as well as start a new fast.</p>

</blockquote>

<h2 id="ongoing-fast">Ongoing Fast</h2>
<p>Once you start a new fast, the timer starts counting either upwards or downwards to your set time. The elapsed time is also shown as a percentage at the top of the time, as well as the fasting start and end times.</p>

<p>You can also do the following from this screen:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Adjust the fast start time.</li>
  <li>Update your fasting journal.</li>
  <li>Share your current fast as an image to Instagram story, message, Facebook or to the default sharing options.</li>
  <li>End the fast.</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll also see the current fasting zone, which is a Zero Plus feature that displays details of the fasting zone when tapped.</p>
