I"û	<p>The Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation (‚ÄúEGPAF‚Äù) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to preventing pediatric HIV infection and eliminating pediatric AIDS through research, advocacy, and prevention and treatment programs.</p>

<p>In pursuant of their goals, they contracted me to design the foundation of their company intranet, after which it was passed on to developers for final design. The intranet is shown below:</p>

<div class="media logos">
<ul>
<li class="hvr-float">
    <img src="/assets/foto/varie/lazyload.png" data-src="/assets/foto/studio/awf_01.jpg" alt="African Wildlife Foundation Intranet" class="lazyload" />
    <div class="caption">
        <h3>African Wildlife Foundation Intranet</h3>
    </div>
</li>
<div class="break"></div>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Companies of all sizes often suffer from miscommunication - between executives and middle-management, between departments, between locations, etc. Whether you‚Äôre trying to collaborate on a document, send an announcement to your team, or gather feedback from your entire department, a well-designed intranet is the best tool for internal communications.</p>

<p>If your company doesn‚Äôt have one, or you have an intranet that no one uses, you are missing out on a prime opportunity. Get in touch and we‚Äôll work on getting you an intranet your employees will use to increase engagement, improve internal communication, and promote corporate culture.</p>
