                want, and some might have no idea. Whatever their take may be, I always ask for their objective, and
                dive deep to understand what can solve their problem.</p>
            <p class="desc"><strong>Design → Review → Iteration</strong><br>From wireframes to high-fidelity designs, I
                take client engagement in high regard. Reviews and feedback make part in the success of the project.
                Necessary iterations can take place until we achieve the final desired solution.</p>
