            <p class="desc">But I do have curiosity.</p>
            <p class="desc">And I believe that to solve a problem, you need to talk about it. You need to look at it from every angle. To discuss and debate it. To pull it apart, and then put it back together again. And I believe in doing all of these things together.</p>
            <p class="desc">Conversation, consideration and collaboration. That’s my process.</p>
