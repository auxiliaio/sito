Here’s what’s taking up most of my time at the moment:

- Working as a [Digital Designer][1].
- Writing about [Apps & Services][2] that get things done.
- Learning the [Nuxt.js][3] Vue Framework.
- Reading [Bachelor Pad Economics][4] by Aaron Clarey.
- Listening to [If Tomorrow Comes][5] by Sidney Sheldon.
- Watching [Invincible][6].
