Here’s what’s taking up most of my time at the moment:

- Working as a [Digital Designer][1].
- Writing about [Apps & Services][2] that get things done.
- Learning the [Nuxt.js][3] Vue Framework.
- Reading [Mastery][4] by Robert Greene.
- Listening to [Archangel One][5] by Evan Currie.
- Watching [Blindspot][6].
