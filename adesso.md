Here’s what’s taking up most of my time at the moment:

- Freelancing as a [Digital Consultant][1].
- Writing about [Apps & Services][2] that get things done.
- Reading [Company of One][3] by Paul Jarvis.
- Listening to [The Lost Intelligence][4] by Vaugh Heppner.
- Reading [Bachelor Pad Economics][5] by  Aaron Clarey.
- Learning the [Jekyll][6] static site generator.
- Watching [The 100][7].
