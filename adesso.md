Here’s what’s taking up most of my time at the moment:

- Freelancing as a [Digital Consultant](/studio/).
- Reading [Company of One](https://ofone.co) by Paul Jarvis.
- Writing about [Apps & Services](/articles/) that get things done.
- Listening to [Foundryside](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37173847-foundryside) by Robert Jackson Bennett.
- Reading [Just Stop](https://readjuststop.com) by Dain Saint and Mike Tannenbaum.
- Learning the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) static site generator.
- Watching [Legion](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5114356/).
