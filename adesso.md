Here’s what’s taking up most of my time at the moment:

- Freelancing as a [Digital Consultant][1].
- Writing about [Apps & Services][2] that get things done.
- Reading [Company of One][3] by Paul Jarvis.
- Listening to [The Lost Fleet][4] by Raymond L. Weil.
- Reading [Bachelor Pad Economics][5] by Aaron Clarey.
- Learning the [Jekyll][6] static site generator.
- Watching [Mr. Robot][7].
