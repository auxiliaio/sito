Here’s what’s taking up most of my time at the moment:

- Freelancing as a [Digital Consultant][1].
- Writing about [Apps & Services][2] that get things done.
- Reading [Company of One][3] by Paul Jarvis.
- Learning the [Nuxt.js][4] Vue Framework.
- Listening to [The Trials of Apollo][5] by Rick Riordan.
- Reading [Bachelor Pad Economics][6] by Aaron Clarey.
- Watching [Mr. Robot][7].
