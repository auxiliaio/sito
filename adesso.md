Here’s what’s taking up most of my time at the moment:

- Working as a [Digital Consultant][1].
- Writing about [Apps & Services][2] that get things done.
- Reading [Company of One][3] by Paul Jarvis.
<!-- - Learning the [Nuxt.js][4] Vue Framework. -->
- Listening to the [Rebel Fleet Series][5] by B.V. Larson.
<!-- - Reading [Bachelor Pad Economics][6] by Aaron Clarey. -->
- Watching [Mr. Robot][7].
