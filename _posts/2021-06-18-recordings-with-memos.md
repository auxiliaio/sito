We all need to record something now and then, be it a podcast, a tune youâ€™d like to listen to later, a meeting to review or a friend attempting to sing. One of the best ways to do this is the Voice Memos app, available for free on all Apple devices.

# Homescreen
The Voice Memos app is terribly simple. You get a title at the top, a search bar, a list of all your recordings and a big red button at the bottom.

# Recording Screen
Tapping the button opens a minimised recording screen that can be expanded to fill up the whole screen by swiping up. This screen displays:
- Title of the recording. This defaults to the current location of the device, assuming location services have been enabled on the device.
- A waveform of the recording.
- Current recording time.
- Rewind, play/pause and forward buttons.
- A pause button.

# Trimming

Pausing the recording adds a trim button at the top right, above the waveform. Tapping this opens a new trim screen where the current recording can be shortened using the timeline controls. Once done you can either replace the previous recording with the trimmed version then resume recording, or complete it using the Done button.

# Recording
Each recording can be played, trimmed, edited, duplicated, shared or deleted from the app home screen. Deleting it moved it to a recently deleted screen which can then be emptied later on.

Recordings can also be organised into folders for easier management. This is done in the Memos screen, where new folders can be created using the folder button at the bottom right.

# Conclusion
Most current devices offer a recording app by default and Apple's Voice Memos app gets the job done via a simple but powerful interface full of useful features. That is why it's the most use voice recording app on all their platforms, and you should give it a try to see if it'll fit your recording needs.
