Email is one of the oldest forms of communication we use nowadays. Youâ€™d think weâ€™d have learnt how to send them properly, but nothingâ€™s further from the truth. Email etiquette is hard to come by, but thatâ€™s why youâ€™re reading this.

Sending emails should be like robbing a bank: you get in, do your thing, and get out. In as little as time as possible. Hereâ€™s how to do it properly (send an email, not rob a bank).

# Start with the Subject
The subject is a summary of what the email is about. Starting with it grounds you, keeps you honest. Make sure itâ€™s simple and direct. 

{% include media.html file="emails/email_subject.jpg" caption="A short simple subject." class="single"%}

# Add Your Attachments
Few things are as disappointing as having an email clearly indicating that I should kindly find something attached and not finding it. It sours the whole deal. So donâ€™t be that guy or girl. If you have attachments, attach them first. 

And do try to keep the number of attachments small. In case of a large number of files create a compressed folder and send that instead. No one likes the idea of downloading 10 different attachments.

# Pick a Salutation
This depends on your relationship with the email recipient(s). It can be any of the following:
- Dear Sir(s)/Madam
- Dear (name of recipient)
- Good (time of day)
- Hello (name of recipient)
- Hi (name of recipient)

# Type the Email
Keep it short, about 3 paragraphs long. Let the first paragraph be an introduction to what the email is about, the second be a detailed overview and the third a summary and next step to be taken. The shorter the email the more likely itâ€™s going to get read.

# Have an a Engaging Signoff
Itâ€™s good to end the email on an upbeat manner. This helps them remember you. You can:
- Compliment/congratulate: Great working with you, keep up the great work
- Express gratitude: Thank you for the consideration, many thanks
- Anticipatory: to an amazing week, looking forward to, until next time, talk soon
- Calls to action: Let me know what you think, letâ€™s catch up sometime
- Personal: Warmest regards, carpe diem, namaste
- When words wonâ€™t do: xoxo, ðŸ™‚
- Common: Sincerely, cheers

# Add the Email Recipients
Once youâ€™re done with the message, itâ€™s time to add the recipients. Be considerate. Don't be that person that adds everyone in the CC and BCC fields. Only add those individuals that are directly involved in the email content.

# Send the Email
Review the email one last time, then send it. Spark offers a 5 second option to unsend the email in case youâ€™ve forgotten something, or changed your mind.

Thatâ€™s it. Sending emails really is that simple. And in case youâ€™re not using the Spark app to send and receive emails, [read our review](https://auxilia.io/articles/emailing-with-spark/) and see what youâ€™ve been missing.
