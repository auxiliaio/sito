Podcasts have gained prominence in the past couple of years. Simply put, a podcast is a series of spoken audio episodes that often focus on a particular topic or theme. Think of them as radio station programs that you can download and listen to at any time of your choosing.

Podcasts cover a wide range of areas and topics, such as technology, fashion, tv show/movie reviews, stories, self help, productivity, book reviewsâ€¦ basically, any interesting topic out there probably has a podcast for it.

You can listen to podcasts directly from the podcast website, if it has one, or by subscribing to one via an app on your phone or tablet. Some of the most popular podcast apps are Pocket Casts, Overcast, Castro, Anchor, Stitcher, CastBox and Downcast. This article covers Pocket Casts.

Pocket Casts is available for iOS, Android, macOS, Windows and the web. Itâ€™s free to download on iOS and Android. The web player requires a subscription to use, as do additional features in the mobile apps. You can downloaded it from [the official website.](https://www.pocketcasts.com)

 The app has a modern design that fits in well on all platforms. Once installed you'll see four tabs at the bottom: Podcasts, Filters, Discover, and Profile.

# Podcasts

This tab shows all your subscribed podcasts. These can:

- Be sorted by name, date added and release date.
- Be arranged in a grid of 3/4 or list.
- Have their badges turned on/off.
- Be shared as lists.

Tapping on a podcast icon opens the podcast page with info on what the podcast is about, the downloaded episodes, when the episodes aired, and settings for changing when the podcast is downloaded, whether to get notifications and whether to skip intro and outro music like the power user that you are.

Think of filters as playlists that collect your podcasts depending on conditions that youâ€™ve set. These conditions cover:

- All podcasts
- Unplayed, In progress and/or played podcasts

# Discover

This tab contains the podcast directory, where podcasts can be searched and subscribed to. Itâ€™s organised into:

Subscribing to a podcast adds it to the Podcast tab. Episodes can also be searched for, and downloaded, without subscribing.

The files are supported by the audio effects just as well as normal podcasts episodes. I use this feature a lot as it enables me to listen to audiobooks via Pocket Casts.

- **Speed Adjustment**. You can adjust the playback speed of podcasts, from 0.5x to 3.0x.
