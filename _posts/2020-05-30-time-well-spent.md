I spend a decent amount of time doing this. I’m doing it right now, in fact.

**I’m not alone.**

A lot of people these days spend a lot of time staring at screens. Admit it, you’re one of them. (If you’re reading this, you’re staring at a screen. Gotcha :-)

**We need a filter.**

One that enables us to use tools that lets us connect without getting sucked in. And disconnect, without missing something important.
