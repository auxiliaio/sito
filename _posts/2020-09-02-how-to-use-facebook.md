Ah Facebook. The most popular social network on the planet. Billions of daily users. Billions. So, why write a guide on using one of the most popular apps on the planet?&nbsp;

Well, here’s how I’d suggest you use Facebook:

* On iPhone, long press the app till it starts shaking. Then tap the minus icon at the top left corner, then Delete App.
* On Android, long press the app icon till you see a menu. Tap on delete/uninstall app.
* Finally, go outside and enjoy the sun, or sit back and read a good book.

That’s it. How do you use Facebook? You don't. It causes more [harm than good][1]. So uninstall the app, [download your info][2], [delete your account][3], hell, be a hero and get your friends off Facebook too. Save yourself the stress, and stop using it. Just stop.
