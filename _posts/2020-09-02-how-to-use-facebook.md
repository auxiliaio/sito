Ah Facebook. The most popular social network on the planet. Billions of daily users. Billions. So, why write a guide on using one of the most popular apps on the planet?

Well, here’s how I’d suggest you use Facebook:

* On iPhone, long press the app till it starts shaking. Then tap the x icon at the top left corner.
* On Android, long press the app icon till you see a menu. Tap on delete/uninstall app.
* Finally, go outside and enjoy the sun, or sit back and read a good book.

That’s it. How do you use Facebook? You don't. It causes more [harm than good](https://www.businessinsider.com/biggest-facebook-scandals-list-mark-zuckerberg-leaked-harvard-messages-2019-7?IR=T#2016-former-news-curators-at-facebook-say-the-platform-was-purposefully-excluding-conservative-news-from-its-trending-news-list-4). So delete the app, [download your info](https://www.facebook.com/help/delete_account), [delete your account](https://www.facebook.com/help/delete_account), hell, be a hero and get your friends off Facebook too. Save yourself the stress, and stop using it. Just stop.
