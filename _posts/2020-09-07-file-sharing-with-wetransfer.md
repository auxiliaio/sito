Files can be shared online in a wide variety of ways. They can be emailed, texted via WhatsApp, iMessage, Telegram, and via file storage services such as Dropbox, Google Drive and OneDrive.

Alternatively, for temporary file sharing, you can use services such as [WeTransfer](https://wetransfer.com) that provide file sharing services without creating an account. All you’ll need is the recipient’s email address and the files you’re sending.

# Home Page
Go to [WeTransfer.com](https://wetransfer.com). Once you agree to the terms and agreements you’ll get a very simple and easy-to-use interface.

- Use the blue ‘Add your files’ button to add files, up to a maximum of 2GB.
- Enter the email account of the file recipient. You can enter multiple email accounts.
- Enter your own email address.
- Type a message.

Once you’re done adding all the files and recipient, press the Transfer button.
