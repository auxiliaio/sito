Intermittent fasting, currently one of the world’s most popular health trends, is an eating plan where you switch between eating and fasting on a regular schedule. Unlike most diets, it’s not concerned with *what* you eat, but rather *when* you eat.

There are a number of apps and services that can help keep track of your fasting. One of these apps is Zero.

# Onboarding
Zero is available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/ke/app/zero-simple-fasting-tracker/id1168348542) and the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zerofasting.zero&hl=en_US). While it’s free to download and use, it also has a subscription plan that enhances the fasting experience.

Launching the app takes you through a 5-step onboarding process that introduces the app, guides you through choosing a fasting plan, setting the timer and creating an account to track your fasting.

Zero gives you 5 fasting reasons:
- Manage weight
- Improve mental clarity
- Live longer
- Increased daily energy
- Following medical advice
- Gut rest

Select the ones that apply to you. You also have the option of selecting the times you start and stop eating.

Once you’re done with the previous step you’ll be provided with the fasting type that applies to you, as well as the option to create an account for tracking your fasting sessions. You can also log into your account if you’ve got one already.

# Timer
Since intermittent fasting tracks when you have your meals, a reliable timer is integral to the whole process. Zero delivers one that does just that in the timer screen.

The total number of people fasting at the current time is displayed at the top, with your current fast displayed under it, which you can tap to change the type of fast you’re doing.

The large circular timer is displayed at the center of the screen, and it has two states:

## Pre-Fasting
This displays the time since the last fast, as well as the upcoming fast duration. You can also change the type of fast, set a fasting reminder as well as start a new fast.

## Ongoing Fast
Once you start a new fast, the timer starts counting either upwards or downwards to your set time. The elapsed time is also shown as a percentage at the top of the time, as well as the fasting start and end times.

You can also do the following from this screen:
- Adjust the fast start time.
- Update your fasting journal.
- Share your current fast as an image to Instagram story, message, Facebook or to the default sharing options.
- End the fast.

You’ll also see the current fasting zone, which is a Zero Plus feature that displays details of the fasting zone when tapped.

The end fast screen enables you to:
- view the total fasting duration, which can be shared as text.
- share your fast breaker as an image.
- view your start and end fasting times, with options for adjusting them.
- record your current mood.
- delete the fast.
- save the fast.

# Fasting Goals
Zero provides 6 different Time Restricted Fasting (TRF) options:

# History
