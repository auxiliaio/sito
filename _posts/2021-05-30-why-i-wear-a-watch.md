We all need to record something now and then, be it a podcast, a tune youâ€™d like to listen to later, a meeting to review or a friend attempting to sing. One of the best ways to do this is the Voice Memos app, available for free on all Apple devices.

# Homescreen
The Voice memos app is terribly simple. You get a title at the top, a search bar, a list of all your recordings and a big red record button at the bottom.

# Recording Screen
Tapping the button opens a minimised recording screen that can be expanded to fill up the whole screen by swiping up. The
- Title of the recording. This defaults to the current location of the device, assuming location has been enabled.
- A waveform of the recording.
- Current recording time.
- Rewind, play/pause and forward buttons.
- A pause button.

# Trimming

Pausing the recording adds a trim button at the top right, above the waveform. Tapping this opens a new trim screen where the current recording can be shortened. Once done you can either replace then resume recording or complete it using the Done button.

# Memo
Each memo can be played back, trimmed, edited, duplicated, shared and deleted from the home screen. Deleting it moved it to a recently deleted screen which can then be emptied later on.

Memos can also be organised into folders for easier management.
